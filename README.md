Project Description:

**Project Title:** Automated Student Report Card Generation System

**Project Overview:**
The Automated Student Report Card Generation System is a Java-based application that automates the process of generating student report cards in both PDF and Excel formats. The system takes input data in JSON format, containing student details and their academic performance. It leverages the JasperReports library for creating visually appealing report cards and Apache POI for generating Excel files.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Input:** The system accepts input data in JSON format, which includes student information such as name, roll number, and a list of academic subjects, along with their marks and grades.

2. **Report Generation:** For each student, the system dynamically generates report cards in both PDF and Excel formats. Each report card includes the student's name, roll number, and a detailed list of academic subjects with marks and grades.

3. **Customization:** The system allows for customization of report card templates and styles using the JasperReports library. Users can design the report card layout to match their specific requirements.

4. **Batch Processing:** It supports batch processing, enabling the generation of report cards for multiple students in a single compilation run. Each report card is named after the student's roll number for easy identification.

5. **Output Storage:** The generated report cards are stored in a specified directory on the local file system. Users can easily access and distribute the report cards as needed.

**Technologies Used:**

- Java: The core programming language for developing the application.
- JasperReports: Used for designing and generating report cards in PDF format.
- Apache POI: Used for creating Excel files.
- JSON: Data input is accepted in JSON format.
- File I/O: Utilized for saving the generated report cards to the file system.

**Benefits:**

- Efficient and time-saving: The system automates the report card generation process, eliminating the need for manual report card creation.
- Consistency: Ensures a consistent format and structure for all report cards.
- Scalability: Can be easily scaled to handle a large number of students.
- Customization: Allows for customization of report card templates to meet specific school or institution requirements.

**Future Enhancements:**

- User authentication and role-based access control.
- Integration with a database for data storage.
- Web-based interface for easier data input and report card retrieval.

The Automated Student Report Card Generation System simplifies the often time-consuming and error-prone task of creating student report cards, providing educational institutions with a more efficient and reliable solution.
